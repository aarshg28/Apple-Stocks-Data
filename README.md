# Apple-Stocks-Data
Stock Market Analysis and Prediction is a project that uses Apple stocks data for technical analysis, visualization, and prediction. By examining data from the stock market, notably from some of the world's largest technological companies and others. We will use pandas to obtain stock data, visualized several elements of it, and then looked at a few different approaches to analyze a stock's risk based on its past performance history. The main goal of this project will be to compare the performance of prediction algorithms on stock market data and gain a broad understanding of this data through visualization in order to forecast future stock behavior and risk value for each stock. We are mainly trying to use NumPy, Pandas, and Data Visualization Libraries in this project.
